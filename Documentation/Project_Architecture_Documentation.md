# **Section 1 - DOTlog iOS Description**

## 1.1 DOTlog iOS

DOTlog iOS is the Apple iOS application component of DOTlog

## 1.2 Description

DOTlog iOS provides a mechanism for DOTlog event creation. Users login to the app and sync their airports and categories from the DOTlog server. Once initially synced, DOTlog users can enter events without network connectivity to the DOTlog server, syncing back events at a later date.

# **Section 2 - Overview**

## 2.1 Purpose

This documentation is intended for the Department of Transportation Information Technology staff and anyone tasked with supporting users of DOTlog iOS. This documentation will give any reader an understanding of all the parts of DOTlog iOS and how to work with and troubleshoot it.

## 2.2 Scope

DOTlog iOS is intended for use by any DOTlog users with the State of Alaska DOT, particularly those users who may be in the field or without constant internet connectivity.

## 2.3 Requirements

iOS 8.2

Xcode 6.3 (for compilation)



# **Section 3 - System Architecture**



DOTlog iOS will be integrate with the DOTlog ColdFusion web application, performing Windows(NTLM) authentication to the web server and performing syncing with the DOTlog API.

# 

# **Section 4 - Core Data Model**

Local storage is achieved using Apple’s built in Core Data model utilities. An entity description is provided below.

# **Section 5 - Software Design**

## 5.1 iOS Storyboard and Views



The iOS app uses a number of types of view components. 

The regions of the Storyboard are shown in the diagram above and follow the hierarchy:



TabBarViewController - Splits app into two Tabs, Events and Accounts Settings

ViewEventsList - Lists events and has Sync and Add Event buttons

ViewSyncCredentials - Displayed when sync called if no credentials saved

ViewAddEvent - View for adding new event.

ViewAddEventCategory - View for selecting event category

ViewAddEventRegion - View for selecting event region, if > 1.

ViewAddEventDistrict - View for selecting event district, if > 1.

ViewAddEventHub - View for selecting event hub, if > 1.

ViewAddEventAirport - View for selecting event airport.

ViewAccountsSettings - Shows server address and saved login information.

ViewAccountsSettingsTableView - Allows for well formatted data presentation.

## 5.2 API Handling Components

UML Class diagram of the classes involved in the API handling.

# **Section 6 – Components to customize in final environment**

When DOTlog iOS is deployed there are components which may require adjusting to match the final environment.

## 6.1 Default DOTlog Domain Address

**Description** : The default URL that populates the Address field in the Account Settings tab. Should include http/https specification and not have anything trailing after TLD.

**File** : DOTlog/API/APIResource.swift

**Variable** : defaultBaseURL

## 6.2 API URIs

**Description** : The location where the APIs keep the resource identifiers.

**Files** : DOTlog/API/APIAirportResource.swift & APICategoryResource.swift & APIEventResource.swift

**Variables** : airportURI, categoryURI, eventURI

## 6.3 Default HTTPS behavior

**Description** : When a user enters a domain without specifying a protocol scheme, it will default to HTTPS. Users may type HTTP manually to achieve that result. Behavior by modifying the scheme variable in saveURL function.

**File** : DOTlog/Views/ViewAccountSettingsTableView.swift

**Variable** : `scheme` local to saveURL function.



# **Section 7 - Alert and Error Documentation**

# **Section 8 - Dependent & Included Libraries / Frameworks / Assets**

This section contains the external projects that are incorporated in or used by DOTlog iOS. 

## 8.1 SwiftyJSON

SwiftyJSON is a JSON deserialization library for Swift. DOTlog iOS uses it to parse the JSON received from the airport and category API calls.



8.2.1 License & Copyright

SwiftyJSON is published under the MIT license, and is provided for free for any use without warranty by the copyright holder Ruoyu Fu.

8.2.2 Inclusion

SwiftyJSON is linked as a git submodule in the DOTlog iOS repository and is not redistributed in the DOTlog iOS code, although it is required for compilation.

8.2.3 Software Location

[https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)

## 8.2 Locksmith

Locksmith is included inside the KeychainAccess class in DOTlog iOS. The purpose of Locksmith is to provide a Swift-friendly wrapper around Apple’s iOS keychain libraries for secure, encrypted app storage. The KeychainAccess class in DOTlog iOS uses Locksmith to store saved account credentials.



8.2.1 License & Copyright

The Locksmith version used was published under the MIT license, and is provided for free for any use without warranty by the copyright holder Matthew Palmer.

8.2.2 Inclusion

	Locksmith is included in it’s entirety statically inside the KeychainAccess.swift file.

8.2.3 Software Location

	[https://github.com/matthewpalmer/Locksmith/](https://github.com/matthewpalmer/Locksmith/)



## 8.3 Icons & Images

All icons in DOTlog iOS are either part of Apple’s framework or in the public domain.

The DOTlog logo was designed by Nathan Helms and is licensed within the project. The DOT banner used within the application are the property of the State of Alaska and are used in coordination of the Department of Transportation.



# **Section 9 - Extra Design Features / Outstanding Issues**

## 9.1 Logout must exit app & User misreporting

When a user attempts to logout of the App they are notified that the app must exit.

The reason behind this is that the networking library in iOS 8.1 started to use cached NTLM authentication for new network connections for a short period of time after the last use before the previous network connections fully finish closing, usually 15 to 60 seconds. This behavior is exhibited even when persistent credential storage is set to never save credentials.



Allowing a user to “logout” (clear their stored credentials) immediately would initiate their sync under the old user whose session is still active.



**NOTE** : This behavior may still happen if the username/password stored are changed without using the logout button.

## 9.2 KeychainAccess errors ignored

Any errors encountered with the internal credential storage library, or the access to it through Locksmith, are ignored. This is partially because we must delete the old credentials before storing knew ones; the delete operation returns an error if there is no existing remembered user, and as that is an expected result the error is unhandled. Errors returned in the save operation are returned by KeychainAccess but the callers do not implement error checking at this time.



## 9.3 Summary Field maximum length

The maximum length of the summary field is limited to 4000 characters. This is set in the ViewAddEvent.swift file, in the variable SUMMARYCHARLIMIT.
